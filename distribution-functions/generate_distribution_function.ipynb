    "A key activity in Monte Carlo modeling is to sample random numbers from a distribution.  Numpy contains implementations for a number of distributions, include uniform (every value between 0 and 1 is equally likely) and normal (values are gaussian distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other types of distributions one might wish to draw from, and that is where generating distributions come from.  This represents the simplest type of \"generative model\" we can envision - we choose it not because it is a hard problem, but rather because it is a simple way to conceive of the generative modeling problem and develop intuition on the problem.\n",
